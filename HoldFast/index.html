        Hold Fast. As part of the Cork Harbour Festival and in collaboration with Backwater Artists Group, studio member Seán Hanrahan presents a body of work in two of the cells, of the former Punishment Block in Spike Island. The work reflects on the maritime theme of tattoos, which are perhaps one of the most recognisable visual forms, when we think of the culture of sailors. Tattoos are also very much part of prison culture. The exhibition will reference popular images of tattoos, such as the nautical star, anchor and swallows and explore the correlation between both cultures, in relation to this theme.

HOLD FAST: Physically, the term Hold Fast means to bear down and fight through the storm, it also indicates a sailor’s career as a deckhand, by the tattoos on their hands of the same name.
